After running these checksums against the original files in the stging folder:

md5sum: WARNING: 16 computed checksums did NOT match
./Varroa_jacobsoni/trackList.json: FAILED

There are 16 files that do not match and need to be manually updated
There are three files that I didn't have when I did this work on stage

This leaves me 19 files I need to adjust.
