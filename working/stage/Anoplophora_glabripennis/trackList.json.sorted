Total RNA was isolated from whole larvae using the Power Microbiome RNA isolation kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA) and ribosomal RNA was depleted from the sample using the Ribominus Eukaryotic Kit for RNA Seq (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).  The library was prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and the library was enriched for 175 nt fragments so that the paired ends overlapped by 30 nt.",
        "Read cleaning method": "Paired reads were quality filtered using ea-utils.  Pairs where one or both reads had a mean quality score less of than 30 were discarded.",
        "Rearing conditions": "Asian longhorned beetle adults were allowed to mate and oviposit onto potted sugar maple trees maintained at a USDA-approved quarantine greenhouse located at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.  60 days after the eggs hatched (indicated by the first appearance of frass), trees were harvested and third instar larvae were collected and surface sterilized with 70% ethanol.",

        "Track legend": "These Tophat RNA-seq mapping results are displayed so that the parts corresponding to the actual reads are colored in dark blue while the introns spanning the predicted splicing sites are light blue. Indels and substitutions identified during the mapping are also color marked:<br>Red - deletion in the read relative to the reference<br>Green - insertion in the read relative to the reference<br>Yellow - mismatch (hover over the mismatch to see what the snp is)"
